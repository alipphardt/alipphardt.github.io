                  <p>* Estimates are considered unreliable. Data preceded by an asterisk have a relative standard error (RSE) greater than 30% and less than or equal to 50% and should be used with caution. Data not shown have an RSE greater than 50%.</p>
                  <p>[1] Derived from three source questions: ""In any one year, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic beverage?""; ""In your entire life, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic beverage?"" and ""In the past year, how often did you drink any type of alcoholic beverage?"" Categories are derived from respondentsâ€™ self-reported responses to a series of questions about alcohol consumption. A lifetime abstainer had fewer than 12 drinks in his or her lifetime. A former infrequent drinker had at least 12 drinks in his or her lifetime but fewer than 12 drinks in any 1 year and no drinks in the last year. A former regular drinker had at least 12 drinks in any 1 year AND had no drink in the past year. A current infrequent drinker had at least 12 drinks in his or her lifetime and fewer than 12 drinks in the past year. A current regular drinker had at least 12 drinks in his or her lifetime and at least 12 drinks in the past year.</p>
