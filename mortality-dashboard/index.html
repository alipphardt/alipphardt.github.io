The death rates for "12 months ending with quarter" (also called moving average rate) are the average rates for the 12 months that end with the quarter on the horizontal time axis. Estimates for the 12-month period ending with a specific quarter include all seasons of the year and, thus, are insensitive to seasonality. The rate for the 12-month period ending with the fourth quarter of 2015 includes deaths that occurred from January 2015 through December 2015. For comparability with rates for 12-month periods, the quarterly (3-month period) rates have been annualized to present deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected if the quarter specific rate prevailed for 12 months.</p>

				<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Deaths from unintentional injury were identified using underlying cause-of-death codes V01–X59, and Y85–Y86 in the <em>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</em>. The death rates for "12 months ending with quarter" (also called moving average rate) are the average rates for the 12 months that end with the quarter on the horizontal time axis. Estimates for the 12-month period ending with a specific quarter include all seasons of the year and, thus, are insensitive to seasonality. The provisional death rates for unintentional injury may be underestimated 1-3% for the 2014 12-month estimates and 3-7% for the 2015 3-month estimates. For comparability with rates for 12-month periods, the quarterly (3-month period) rates have been annualized to present deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected if the quarter specific rate prevailed for 12 months.</p>
