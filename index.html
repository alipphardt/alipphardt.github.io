            Word Embeddings Demo
          </a>
        </h3>This R Markdown report, published to RPubs, demonstrates the use of several machine learning and natural language processing techniques surrounding the concept of word embeddings. Word embeddings are a form of language modeling using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to map words from a selected vocabulary to a vector of numbers. By representing words with vectors, we can map words to a point in a high dimensional geometric space. The goal of word embedding models are to place words in this geometric space such that words with high semantic similarity are close together. This project will examine how terms within a corpus of death records may be represented with word embedding models. </li><li>
